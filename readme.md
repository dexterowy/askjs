# AskJs.com
##This is my semestral project for high school. Website for asking questions about JavaScript.

Design is ugly but it can be. The main target for that project is to create own cms with following functionalities:
- sing in/up
- adding posts/questions
- adding some pictures
- answering/commenting for a questions
- tools for an administrator to accept question, move post beetween categories, etc.
- storing everything in a db also images wihich are stored on server


This is not perfect but it works :D


### Never use it! I can't remove it, because I spend with that project a lot of hours.
